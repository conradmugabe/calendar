# ðŸ“‘ Calendar â€“ Technical Plan / Design Document

### Overview
This document outlines the system architecture, technologies, 
constraints, sub-systems and communication flow for a 
Calendar application.

This problem is not new, and has been solved before by platforms
like Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc. However, this
document will focus on building a simple calendar application
that allows users to create, update, delete and view events.

The goal is to have this project open-source.

## The goal
- A user should be able to create an event, update it,
  delete it and view it.
- A user should be able to invite people to an event.
- A user should be able to view events on the calendar.
  The events are past, present and future.
- A user should be able to set reminders for an event.
- A user should be able to set recurring events.
- A user should be able to view the calendar in different
  views like day, week, month and year.
- A user should be able to add notes and other attachments
  to an event.
